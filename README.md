This is the final project at course [Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-in) at Edx.The project idea is to make Space Invaders game with
Tiva c to apply all concepts that teached through this course like ADC, DAC, Interrupts, SPI, Timers ... etc. Code was not Professional enough as it was my first course in Embedded Systems Field. 

## Game-Instructions

The Game is consits of 3 levels for the first level you have to kill 4 enemies , at the second one it would be 8 enemies , and 12 enemies at third level. all levels 
have also a special enemy with speed high than all enemies. Enemies will try to kill you by their shoots so you should kill them by laser shoots before they killed you.
you have 3 lives which means that you can got 3 enemies shoots then you will lost at the fourth one.
you have Fire button,Pause button, joystick to move in x axis, LCD to visualize the game, Speaker to hear the sound of shoots, and two leds green one indicates that 
you kill an enemy and red one indicates that you have got an enemy shoot.

## Software-and-Hardware-Used
